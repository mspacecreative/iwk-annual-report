						<h2>Leadership Message</h2>
						<p>
							Because it Matters – three words that capture the essence of everything we do here at the IWK Health Centre and the ideal theme for our 2018-19 annual report to the community. Because it Matters recognizes the dedication, compassion and excellence of our employees, physicians, volunteers and partners who work relentlessly and passionately to pursue a healthy future for women, children, youth and families.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this year’s report we are sharing a glimpse into a few of the areas we, as an organization, have made great strides over the past 12 months. We continue to work closely with our patient and family partners in improving how they and others access our care, engaging them on the design of new areas, and most importantly ensuring their voices are heard prior to significant decisions being made.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have focussed on initiatives and programs across the Health Centre that ensure the IWK continues to be a safe place for our patients as they receive their needed care, and advocated on their behalf on issues that might bring them harm, now or in the future. And for those new to our community, we stepped up to support their unique needs and requirements.
						</p>
						<p>
							As always research and innovation are vital components of the IWK’s success. By taking research directly to patients and families, our researchers have continued to discover and implement innovative solutions that have a significant and real impact on the health and well-being of patients across Canada and around the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the year ahead, we are excited by the completion of another phase of our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit redevelopment, the start of construction of our new Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, as well as the new design for our Children’s Emergency Department. We will do all of this hand-in-hand with our patient partners to ensure we always view our work from their lens.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s no secret that the people who work at the IWK are special individuals. They continue to push the envelope, whether they work directly with patients and families, or are integral in supporting the work of those who do.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything they do, they do with a singular focus -- Because it Matters.

								<h3>Speaking Out On Cannabis Impacts</h3>
								<p>In the past ten years, cannabis related calls to the IWK Regional Poison Centre more than double. The presence of cannabis at home places children at risk of unintentional exposures and could result in accidental poisoning or other serious health concerns. Health experts from across the Health Centre develop a number of detailed, evidence-based, recommendations for government to consider and present the IWK’s recommendations to the Legislature’s Law Amendments Committee. IWK experts Dr. Andrew Lynk and Dr. Alexa Bagnell speak to the media about the fact that THC cannabis use has been medically proven to be harmful on numerous fronts, especially with regards to driving, learning and impairing healthy brain development for adolescents and adults under age 25.</p>

							As the fundraising partner of the IWK Health Centre, the IWK Foundation and its donors believe that Maritime women and children deserve access to nothing less than the best health care, right here at home. It’s through the continued generosity and support of the Maritime community that the IWK continues to grow and evolve as a world-class facility. Last year, IWK donors contributed more than $15 million to support the most urgent care priorities including new equipment, updated facilities, the latest technology and research.
